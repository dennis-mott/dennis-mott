## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I'm Dennis, and I'm looking to use my experience as an engineer to transition to a data science position.
#### Check out my [Personal Website](dennis-mott.github.io) I made using Github Pages.

## My Data Science Work
- Have you ever walked through the woods and wondered if the mushrooms you found are poisonous or not? If you want to make good decisions in the woods, check out my [Mushroom Classifier](mushroom_classifier.ipynb).

## Never Stop Learning
#### - *5/19/2025 to 5/21/2025* : Microsoft Build 2025 was superb! The Azure suite of products for AI and data science is out of this world. Being a science geek, I found the Microsoft Discovery platform very interesting. The [example](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/datacenter-liquid-cooling/#:~:text=Liquid%20cooling%20is%20a%20proven?msockid=330688559fe368fd35cf9a929e9d69d8) they shared which AI help develop a solution to fully imerse servers to cool them is truly inspirational!

#### - *3/31/2025 to 4/4/2025* : Kaggle's 5 Day Intensive Generative AI (2025) by Google was amazing! AI is not my specialty but I learned so much about Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering, Embeddings & Vector Databas, Generative AI Agents, Domain-Specific LLMs, and MLOps for Generative AI. I can't wait to see what next year has in store, surely my AI skills will have progressed by then!
